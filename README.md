# Godot 4.3 RPC Examples

Honetly just an easy "grab and go" for dedicated server setup. Also good for reference.

There is GDScript and C# versions so take you pick if you want to grab for either of those languages. If someone has versions for other languages tottaly open to PR's!

## How To

If you open the project and want to use the C# or GDscript version simply change the script that is attached to the GameEntryPoint node to the respective `Main.{gd,cs}` script. Export the server and run it with the args `--server --headless` (headless is optional but it stops the server from opening a gameplay window).

### Note
I've not tested the server with diffrenelt langauge for client and server but in theory it should work as well!

Happy Game Dev'ing!
